            <h2>HOLKEN LORE</h2>
            <p>
                In the small town of Hölö, young Albert is walking in the corridors of Hölö Skolan.
                His math lesson starts in five minutes, and he now has to rush to make it in time.
                Just as the bell rings, he opens the door to the classroom and takes his seat.
                The teacher took a good look at him and nodded carefully. The lesson goes on and
                the teacher asks the class if someone can solve the mathematic equation displayed on the
                whiteboard. No one extends their hand to answer, and Albert is now asked whether or not
                he can solve the equation. Slowly, he stands up in his seat and starts shuddering words
                incomprehensible to the rest of the class. Albert can feel them staring at him.
                He finally speaks up and says something along the lines "2 squared is equal to 5".
                Dead silence… A laugh can be heard echoing from the back of the class and the other pupils
                soon begin to cry in laughter. The teacher, now with disappointment in their eyes, pointed
                at the door, signaling that Albert should leave the classroom. As he makes his way to the door
                rest of the class began chanting in between their laughter. Holken Albert! Holken Albert!
                Holken Albert! (Holken is a room for students who need extra help with schoolwork and is often
                seen as a room for stupid individuals). He could still hear the students chanting in the classroom
                when he arrived at Holken. He took a good grip on the door handle and promised himself that he
                would prove them wrong. Determined to one day escape Holkens grasp and have revenge on his peers.
